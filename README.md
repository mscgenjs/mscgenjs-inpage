## Usage

(1) Reference the mscgen-inpage **script** in your **page head**:

```html
<script src="dist/mscgen-inpage.js" defer></script>
```

> The script is also available for inclusion on your page on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/mscgenjs-inpage),
> [mscgen.js.org](https://mscgen.js.org/mscgen-inpage.js) and [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/mscgenjs-inpage/master/dist/mscgen-inpage.js) if you just want to use it for quick testing.

(2) Put your mscgen script in the page, surrounded by a tag with **`mscgen_js`**
as one of its **`class`** attributes.

```html
<pre class="mscgen_js">
    # OpenId Connect protocol
    # https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.1.3
    msc {
      wordwraparcs="true";

      eu [label="end-user"],
      rp [label="relying party"],
      op [label="OpenID provider"];

      eu =>> rp [label="log me in"];
      rp =>> op [label="authentication request"];
      op =>> eu [label="authentication and authorization request"];
      eu >> op [label="authenticate and authorize"];
      op >> rp [label="authentication response"];
      rp =>> op [label="UserInfo request"];
      op >> rp [label="UserInfo response"];
      rp >> eu [label="Hi. You're logged in with {UserInfo.name}"];
    }
    </pre
>
```

(3) **You're done**. The script replaces all elements in the page with the class
mscgen_js by a rendered sequence chart. Result for the above msc:

> We've used `pre` in the sample above, but mscgen_js will work with any
> element type. You can even use `<script>` and wikimedia-style `<mscgen>`
> tags - see the [mscgen_js embedding guide](https://sverweij.github.io/mscgen_js/embed.html#script-tag)
> if you want to do this.

## More

- The [mscgen_js embedding guide](https://sverweij.github.io/mscgen_js/embed.html)
  covers more options, e.g.:
  - How to read MscGen from external files.
  - How to embed MscGen in Atlassian Confluence.
  - Using `<script>` or `<mscgen>` for rendering.
  - Making the charts clickable, so they open in the on line interpreter.
  - Using other sequence chart languages (like XÃ¹ and MsGenny)
- If you want to write MscGen: it's a doddle in the
  [on line interpreter](https://sverweij.github.io/mscgen_js) or the
  [atom package](https://atom.io/packages/mscgen-preview).
- This (npm) package has completely replaced the provisional [bower
  package](https://github.com/mscgenjs/mscgen_js-inpage-package) released
  in 2015.
